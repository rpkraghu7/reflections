What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When I initialize a repository a hidden file named .git gets created in the repository or the directory I'm working on and I need it because
  I can work on my own project and share it with other people using git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

  staging area is an area where you would stage the files you wish to commit and working directory is the directory or repository we are currently working
  on. These offer separate values with respect to each but each have it's own important role to follow.
